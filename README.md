# PyPageCache

## Introduction

Welcome to PyPageCache, a tool designed to help you manage and understand disk page caching in your Python applications. 

Whether you're working on a data-intensive application or building a database, PyPageCache provides insights into how your code interacts with the disk and OS page cache.

## Installation

You can install PyPageCache using pip:

```bash
pip install pypagecache
```

## Getting Started

### View how many pages are in cache
To start using PyPageCache, import the module and create an instance by specifying the path to the file or directory you want to monitor:

```python
from pypagecache import PyPageCache

cache_stats = PyPageCache("/path/to/your/file_or_directory").stats()
print(cache_stats)
```
This should print something like this:
```text
=> Page cache stats: [14359/14359] (100.0%)
```
This indicates that this directory/file contains 14359 pages and all of it are in page cache.


### Warming the cache
Want to reduce the page faults in your app by prewarming the page cache? 
Simply touch all files you care about. 
```python
PyPageCache("/path/to/files").evict()
```
Obviously caching beyond your physical memory limits will result in eviction of older pages. 


### Evicting file pages from cache
Let's say you want to start afresh and see how your app performs when there are no data pages lying in your page cache. You can evict your data files & perform the test.

```python
PyPageCache("/path/to/files").evict()
```
Obviously caching beyond your physical memory limits will result in eviction of older pages. 


## Recipes

Now that we know what are the basic operations that we can leverage. Let's do something more interesting.
Let's see if we can include this as part of our specs.

### Testing Cached pages by your app
```python
import unittest
from pypagecache import PyPageCache

class TestPyPageCache(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        # Set up PyPageCache for a specific file
        self.test_file_path = "/path/to/test/file.txt"
        self.ppc = PyPageCache(self.test_file_path)

        # Perform cache eviction to ensure a clean slate
        self.ppc.evict()

    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up resources if needed
        pass
    
    def my_io_intensive_function(self):
        # Execute code that performs disk I/O on the specified file
        with open(self.test_file_path, 'r') as file:
            # Read the first 5 lines from the file
            return '\n'.join(file.readline() for _ in range(5))


    def test_disk_io_impact(self):
        # replace this with something that you care about
        self.my_io_intensive_function()
        
        # Retrieve and analyze page cache statistics
        stats = self.ppc.stats()
        print(f"File Size: {stats.filesize} bytes")
        print(f"Page Size: {stats.pagesize} bytes")
        print(f"Cached Pages: {stats.cached_pages}")
        print(f"Total Pages: {stats.total_pages}")

        # Add your assertions based on the obtained statistics
        self.assertLess(stats.cached_pages, 20, "Cached pages should be under 20 for a data read")
        self.assertLess(stats.cached_percent(), 1.0, 
                        "Cache ratio should be low since we're only reading top 5 lines." + 
                        "It should not require the entire file to be paged")
        self.assertGreaterEqual(stats.cached_pages, 1, "It should atleast read 1 page")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Dynamic Cache Monitoring in a Loop
If you want to continuously monitor cache statistics while your application is running, you can incorporate PyPageCache into a loop.

```python
import time
from pypagecache import PyPageCache

file_path = "/path/to/your/file.txt"
ppc = PyPageCache(file_path)

while True:
    cache_stats = ppc.stats()
    print(f"Current cache stats: {cache_stats}")
    time.sleep(60)  # Sleep for 1 minute before checking again
```

## Contributing
